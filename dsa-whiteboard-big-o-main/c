   void linearTimeComplexity(int arr[], int size) {
       for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
           // Perform some operation on each element

  //In C and C++, the time complexity of an algorithm can be determined similarly to other programming languages. We'll use Big O notation to describe the complexity. Here are some examples:

//O(n) in C/C++: A simple example of O(n) complexity in C/C++ would be a loop that iterates through an array or a linked list and performs an operation on each element. Here's an example:


//O(1) in C/C++: An example of O(1) complexity in C/C++ would be accessing an element from an array or a linked list by its index. Here's an example:


  void constantTimeComplexity(int arr[], int index) {
       int element = arr[index];
       // Do something with the element
   }
