##O(1)  in Python here is an  illustration of O(1) complexoty in Python would be accessing an element from a list by its index.
def constant_time_complexity(arr, index):
	element = arr[index]
	# Do something with the element.

	##O(1) in Python:
##The time complexity of the constant_time_complexity function is O(1) because accessing an element from a list by its index takes a constant amount of time, regardless of the size of the list.

#time complexities assume that the operations performed within each loop or function take constant time. If the operations themselves have a higher time complexity, it would need to be considered when evaluating the overall time complexity of the algorithm.
#O(n) in Python:
#The time complexity of the linear_time_complexity function is O(n) because it uses a for loop to iterate through each element in the list, performing an operation on each element. The execution time increases linearly with the size of the input list.
