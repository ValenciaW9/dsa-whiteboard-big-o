def linear_time_complexity(array)
    array.each do |element|
        # Perform some operation on each element
    end
end
## O(n) #{}in Ruby an illustration of O(n) complexity #{}in Ruby would be a loop that iterates through an array and performs an operation on each element.


# O(1) in Ruby An illustration of O1 complexity in Ruby would be accessing an element from an array by its index. Heres the illustraton:
def constant_time_linear_time_complexity(array, index)
    # Do something with the element at the given index
    array[index]
end
