// O(1) in Javascript here's a illustration of O(1) complexiy in Javascript would be acessing an element from an array by its index. Here's an illustration:
function constantTimeComplexity(array,index) {
	const element = array [index];
	// Do somehing with the element.
}


// O(n) in JavaScript:
//The time complexity of the linearTimeComplexity function is O(n) because it uses the forEach method to iterate through each element in the array, performing an operation on each element. The execution time increases linearly with the size of the input array.

//O(1) in JavaScript:
//The time complexity of the constantTimeComplexity function is O(1) because accessing an element from an array by its index takes a constant amount of time, regardless of the size of the array.
